# WaterlooWorksSkimmer

A chrome extension helps see the brief information of work experiences just by hovering mouse over the work id instead of opening whole web page of the work.

## Demo

Logging in to [WaterlooWorks](https://waterlooworks.uwaterloo.ca/myAccount/co-op/coop-postings.htm) and switching to job table page, you will find that a tooltip shows when you hover our mouse over the id of each work.

Of course, you can have a custom your own personalized information table by selecting the information you are interested in as is illustrated below.
